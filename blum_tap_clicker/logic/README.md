# Logic code for Blumtap

## Description

This code is written in python version 3.11

The script is based on capturing a separate window to reduce the optimization of the search for **"snowflakes"** in the Blum game.
After finding through the usual arithmetic of the **numpy** module, you can compare the **BGR** of the pixel color and the user's color transmitted to the stream.

There are only **two streams** that react to two colors. Due to the slow speed of Python,
the delay is minimal in order to **collect as many points as possible**.

## Changelog

Optimizing the code and switching to the **nuitka** executable compiler
